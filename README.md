  <h1>Graph View Plugin</h1>
  <p>A tool for Sanity Studio to graph your content and see changes in real-time.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/screengrab.gif" width="540" alt="Screengrab of the Graph tool" /></p>

> This is a Sanity Studio v2 plugin. For the v3 version, please refer to the [v3-branch](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-graph-view).

Wonder how a visualization of your dataset will look? How many authors do you have? How many items have they worked on? And are currently working on! Edits and changes are shown in real-time!

**Explore your data with this plugin, seek out strange corners and data types, boldly go where you could not before!**

## Installation and use

<div style="padding: 1em; border: solid 2px red;">
**Important!** Due to an [outstanding issue with Three.js](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-graph-view/issues/4), you currently **have to use Yarn to install packages, not NPM, and add this to your app's `package.json`**:

```json
  "resolutions": {
    "**/three": "0.119.1"
  }
```
We hope to remedy this in the future.
</div>

```sh
# In your Sanity Studio repository:
sanity install graph-view@studio-v2 

# Start the Studio
sanity start
```

## Configuration

Edit `./config/graph-view.json`:

```json
{
  "query": "*[_type in ['a', 'b']]"
}
```

For references to turn into graph edges, the entire document must be fetched, but you can also selectively filter what references will be included. For example:

```json
{
  "query": "*[_type in ['a', 'b']]{ 'refs': [author, publisher] }"
}
```

By default, the plugin uses `doc.title || doc.name || doc._id` as the node label.

If you want to use another property, compute a `title` property in your query, e.g.:

```json
{
  "query": "*[_type in ['a', 'b']] { ..., \"title\": select(_type == 'a' => 'Title A', _type == 'b' => 'Title B') }"
}
```
